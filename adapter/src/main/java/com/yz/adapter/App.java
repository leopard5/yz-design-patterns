package com.yz.adapter;

/**
 * An adapter helps two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the real world definition
 * for an adapter. Interfaces may be incompatible but the inner functionality should suit the need.
 * The Adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting
 * the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are two variations of the Adapter pattern: The class adapter implements the adaptee's
 * interface whereas the object adapter uses composition to contain the adaptee in the adapter
 * object. This example uses the object adapter approach.
 *
 * <p>
 * The Adapter ({@link BattleFishingBoat}) converts the interface of the adaptee class (
 * {@link FishingBoat}) into a suitable one expected by the client ( {@link BattleShip} ).
 *
 * <p>
 * The story of this implementation is this. <br>
 * Pirates are coming! we need a {@link BattleShip} to fight! We have a {@link FishingBoat} and our
 * captain. We have no time to make up a new ship! we need to reuse this {@link FishingBoat}. The
 * captain needs a battleship which can fire and move. The spec is in {@link BattleShip}. We will
 * use the Adapter pattern to reuse {@link FishingBoat}.
